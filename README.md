# Python-Week-1

Day 1:
Introduction and Onboarding -  I was introduced to the Python course content as well as what is expected of me in the end. Taken through how computers work with regards to memory and how it stores information, how we are able to access it and what happens when we write and run a computer program. I was then taken through installing Python, pip and Jupyter. Jupyter can only be installed using pip, which is the Python package installer which allows us to view most exercise files.

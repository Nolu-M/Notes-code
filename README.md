# Python-Week-1

## Day 1:
### Introduction and Onboarding
I was introduced to the Python course content as well as what is expected of me in the end. Taken through how computers work with regards to memory and how it stores information, how we are able to access it and what happens when we write and run a computer program. I was then taken through installing Python, pip and Jupyter. Jupyter can only be installed using pip, which is the Python package installer which allows us to view most exercise files. Once everything was installed, I ran "jupyter notebook" which opened up the exercise files in the browser and from there I was able to create a new python 3 file which allowed me to run code in python without needing to use the command line. I also installed VS Code and ran the same Python code to see if it also works well on a text editor. Coming into this I was only familiar with VS Code so navigating and understanding Jupyter initially came with a bit of a challenge but I managed to work through it after reading more about it.

### Introduction
This compromised of a knowledge check going over finding the value of a variable when an array was already given and then altered, how a computer reads a comment line in Python and which symbol represents a comment when one is written. I found this questions helpful as they gave me a guide into what I can expect during the Python course. 

## Day 2:
### Variables and Types
I learnt that a variable is a basic unit of a program, which is assigned a value. The variable name cannot begin with a number, otherwise, it won't be used but it can include upper and lower case letters, including underscores. I did note that in Python, variable names begin with lowercase letters. Python has several types of variables such as integers - whole numbers, floats - decimal numbers, complex numbers - for complex calculations, strings - collections of characters, and booleans - true or false. Strings can be concatenated using a plus sign but cannot be used to add stings and numbers.

### Data Structures
These allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable. Which are the following: **List** data structure - order is important, can contain any data type, incl. a list within a list and len funtion is used to determine the length, **Set** data structure - similar to a list, contains unique elements, declared by curly braces and order not important. **Tuples** - similar to lists, cannot be modified once declared, useful in storing large amounts of data in an efficient way in memory. **Dictionary** - collections of key-value pairs and are declared using curly braces and accessed using keys.

### Operators
These instructions that perform operations on variables and values by manipulating and performing actions on data. **Addition (+)** - adding things together to get a result and can concatenate two strings, **multiplication (*)** - multiplies numbers together but can also work with a string, **exponent** - raises a number to specified power, **division (/)** - returns floating point value even if the result is a whole number, **modulus (%)** - provides remainder after division e.g. 20/6 remainder 2 returned by modulus.
Other operators include **comparison operators** - evaluate two variables or values and produce boolean result e.g. ==, <, <=, >, >=. **Logical operators ('and', 'or' and 'not')** - 'and' returns true if both operands true, 'or' returns true if at least one operand is true and 'not' negates (reversing the truth value) boolean value it operates on. **Membership operators ('in' and 'not in')** - 'in' to check if a number of a string exits in given list/string.

### Control Flow
If statement allows us to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. If a condtion is true, indented code under if statement =  executed, if there's more code and an else statement is added, then the code under that = executed if condition is false. Indentation is very important - determines structure of the program.
- **For loop** - used to iterate over a list of any iterable object.
- **While loop** - similar to for loop but keeps looping until a certain condition is false. Important to make sure condition in while loop will eventually = false or loop will continue indefinitely.

### Functions
Like a machine that takes inputs and produces outputs e.g. toaster takes bread, produces toast. Toaster can still apply toasting function even if bread is not used.
- Defined by using *'def'* keyword followed by function name and arguments in parentheses.
- Can take one or more arguments and may or may not return a value.
- may mutate a variable without returning anything e.g. print function only prints output and doesn't return anything.
- keyword *'None'* represents absence of value, default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything.

### Classes and Objects
- Class - help label and organize related collections of functions and attributes.
- E.g. a class called has multiple functions and attributes such as legs, a name and bark.
    - special function (init) created and gets called when instance of class is created.
    - init function takes variable called *'self'* which refers to specific instance of the Dog class.
```
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.legs = 4

    def speak(self):
        print(self.name + ' says: Bark!')
```
- Defining attributes and functions of Dog class. E.g. Dog with four legs and has the name 'Rover' and a function called 'speak', which prints 'bark'.
- These attributes or functions in the class can be accessed using 'self' variable.
- Can be used by creating a new instance by calling 'dog' passing other variables such as name.
- Speak function takes 'self' as first variable ---> instance of the class  
    - class instances ---> objects
        - variables inside these classes ---> attributes
            - functions ---> methods.
```
my_dog = Dog('Rover')
another_dog = Dog('Fluffy')

my_dog.speak()

another_dog.speak()
```
### Factorial challenge
Factorial function gives the number of possible arrangements of a set of items of length 'n'

E.g. 4! ('four factorial') or ways to arrange four items
* can be calculated as 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
* 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
* 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720
* 0! = 1

factorial = ! after a number = to the product of that number and all the integers below it down to one.
If type of 'num' is not an integer, we return none, this includes floats e.g. 1.2 and string. Negative numbers such as '-2' are integers but are also special cases, therefore if number < 0, return none.

- Recursion: when a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
    - all same checks performed then return the number multiplied by the factorial of the number minus one.
    - It calls itself, but with a number that's one smaller than before.
    - all checks repeated until input number = 0 and we return one.
    - factorial of the number if returned.

# Python-Week-1

## Day 1:
Introduction and Onboarding -  I was introduced to the Python course content as well as what is expected of me in the end. Taken through how computers work with regards to memory and how it stores information, how we are able to access it and what happens when we write and run a computer program. I was then taken through installing Python, pip and Jupyter. Jupyter can only be installed using pip, which is the Python package installer which allows us to view most exercise files. Once everything was installed, I ran "jupyter notebook" which opened up the exercise files in the browser and from there I was able to create a new python 3 file which allowed me to run code in python without needing to use the command line. I also installed VS Code and ran the same Python code to see if it also works well on a text editor. Coming into this I was only familiar with VS Code so navigating and understanding Jupyter initially came with a bit of a challenge but I managed to work through it after reading more about it.

Introduction - This compromised of a knowledge check going over finding the value of a variable when an array was already given and then altered, how a computer reads a comment line in Python and which symbol represents a comment when one is written. I found this questions helpful as they gave me a guide into what I can expect during the Python course.
